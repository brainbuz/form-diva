I was not fully prepared for my visit with you last week. Since then I have made some effort to more carefully observe my condition, including stopping medication for a day, I also fell ill on Friday and effectively fasted for a day.

When I was unmedicated after eating I experienced a mild burn, from the middle my belly to the bottom of my sternum. When I was burping the burn would intensify and also the sensation area would start to move further up my sternum. I also frequently experience my stomach as being unsettled, to try to explain it feels like it isn't quite happy and anything could make it unhappy, Famatodine does help with this.

While I was ill and not eating there was no letup in my gas, just drinking water was triggering it. For 5 days after the illness I was also strictly dairy free [I've known I'm Lactose sensitive since my 20s], and continued to have excessive gas.

My perception of the effectiveness of my medication is: Creon moderately reduces the amount of gas but significantly reduces the severity fo stomach disturbance, Famatodine provides more benefit when combined with Creon than by itelf.
